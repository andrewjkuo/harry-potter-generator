      "'Oh, no!' he said, his voice breaking at once, his hands on the inside of his robes and back and forth. 'He's just a madman, really - he's had his mind twisted, he's just a clever, great-grand-father.\n",
      "'Well, there you go, Harry!' said Hermione, bringing her hand up to the letter. 'It's nothing to worry about. I'm not scared, I'm sure he'll keep his face hidden as it is.'\n",
      "Hermione was staring at the letter. Its eyes were bright and open. There was blood. There was a flash of something cold, like water in the fire he had just opened in the garden. Ron was kneeling face to face where he had left Harry's letter.\n",
      "Ron stared blankly, his breathing quick and shallow. Then, at the end, he said his best, 'You should be glad he is here, because he will be much safer now, not in your house, he was just a little bit too frightened to get in here.\n",
      "'No more panic, just calm down,' Ron grunted, and Harry did the same.\n",
      "'So?' said Hermione, looking worried. 'You would've really liked me to keep an eye on him instead of your old colleague when they were in the Chamber of Secrets, Ron? You would've really liked him to be back at your cabin so quick and alert!'\n",
      "There was a deep, agonising silence for a long time.\n",
      "'How could it not be so?' said Hermione, pushing herself up a little too hard to look her in the eyes. 'Where is he now?'\n",
      "'He's in here, it seems to me,' continued Ron.\n",
      "'Oh yeah! And where did you get him?'\n",
      "He did not speak, but he did not feel any guilt about it. He would have known - Professor Snape had shown him a little bit of memory - but he felt it was no great relief to give Malfoy a chance to get in.\n",
      "He saw Professor Snape's expression turn into a kind of defensive grin and then he looked down at the letter. The thought had never occurred to him that he was about to write Snape, but only to the memory of Malfoy sitting alone in the dark and listening to the silence until the last moment of their last meeting.\n",
      "'So?' said Hermione, looking very sad. 'Can't you see Malfoy's face?'\n",
      "The letter was lying against the side of a window. Ron's hand was gripping it with a sharp and painful amount\n",
